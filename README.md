Script built using NodeJS, using fast-csv, fdf.js, and fs modules. I put this together over a weekend for my girlfriends job. The need was to generate 300+ PDFs with prefilled information provided in an excel spreadsheet. I converted the spreadsheet into a CSV file, which then was fed into the script which assigned each delimited field to a header variable. Individual FDF files were created from the CSV, which are then parsed into a PDF form. The FDF + PDF form would then create a new filled PDF file corresponding to each record.
